Here we will outline the project for my costume for Halloween 2016.

## 2016 Update
Project complete! Wore this with a wand I created for trick-or-treating! I got lots of compliments.

Also, I showed this off for my extended family at Thanksgiving. There were tons of new faces there but I was brave with my cape on! :-)
